AstroSource
=============

Package for analysing time-series of sources with variability in their brightness. The package takes a sequence of data files (in FITS format, or photometry files) and will attempt to find stable comparison stars to perform differential photometry against. The package outputs a lightcurve for each input target, as ``.csv``, ``.png`` and ``.eps``. Advanced features can provide output data in absolute magnitudes, detrend periodically varying data, and calculate a simple box model for exoplanet transits.

The package was formerly called ``autovar`` but this clashes with an existing Python package.
